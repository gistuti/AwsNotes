1.Write a function to find max of three numbers.


def maximum_number(num1,num2,num3):
    list=[num1,num2,num3]
    return max(list)
print(maximum_number(13,5,9))

2.Write a Python program to detect the number of local variables declared in a function.
def localvariable():
    a = 0
    b = 2.5
    char1='a'
    str1="Hello India"
print(localvariable.__code__.co_nlocals)
3.Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10
Expected output: 55

def result(x):
    if x<=1:
        return x
    else:
        return x+result(x-1)
print(result(10))

4.Create a function showStudent() in such a way that it should accept student id, name, and itâ€™s college name
and if the id and college name is missing in function call it should show it as by default id is 1 and
college name  is VITA.

def showstudent(student_name,student_id="1",college_name="VITA"):
    print(student_name,"whose",student_id,"from",college_name)

5.	Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
Sample List : [11,22,22,33,33,33,44,55,55,66]
Unique List : [11, 22,33, 44, 55,66]


def sortedlist(mylist1):
    mylist2 = []
    for i in mylist1:
        if i not in mylist2:
            mylist2.append(i)
    return(mylist2)
print(sortedlist([11,22,22,33,33,33,44,55,55,66]))

6.	Write a program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number 2 user defined functions
1st for first digit
2nd for last digit
Example:
 Input:  5424
Output: 9

firstnumber=0
n=int(input())
l=str(n)
q=len(l)
lastdigit=n%10
n=n//10
while(n > 10):
    n = n//10 
firstDigit= n
print(firstDigit+lastdigit)
